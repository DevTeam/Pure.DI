# Usage scenarios.

## Auto-bindings

Injection of non-abstract types is possible without any additional effort.

```c#
using Pure.DI;

// Specifies to create a partial class with name "Composition"
DI.Setup("Composition")
    // with the root "Orders"
    .Root<OrderService>("Orders");

var composition = new Composition();

// service = new OrderService(new Database())
var orders = composition.Orders;

class Database;

class OrderService(Database database);
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)

> [!WARNING]
> But this approach cannot be recommended if you follow the dependency inversion principle and want your types to depend only on abstractions. Or you want to precisely control the lifetime of a dependency.

It is better to inject abstract dependencies, for example, in the form of interfaces. Use bindings to map abstract types to their implementations as in almost all [other examples](injections-of-abstractions.md).

## Injections of abstractions

This example demonstrates the recommended approach of using abstractions instead of implementations when injecting dependencies.

```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Binding abstractions to their implementations:
    // The interface IGpsSensor is bound to the implementation GpsSensor
    .Bind<IGpsSensor>().To<GpsSensor>()
    // The interface INavigationSystem is bound to the implementation NavigationSystem
    .Bind<INavigationSystem>().To<NavigationSystem>()

    // Specifies to create a composition root
    // of type "VehicleComputer" with the name "VehicleComputer"
    .Root<VehicleComputer>("VehicleComputer");

var composition = new Composition();

// Usage:
// var vehicleComputer = new VehicleComputer(new NavigationSystem(new GpsSensor()));
var vehicleComputer = composition.VehicleComputer;

vehicleComputer.StartTrip();

// The sensor abstraction
interface IGpsSensor;

// The sensor implementation
class GpsSensor : IGpsSensor;

// The service abstraction
interface INavigationSystem
{
    void Navigate();
}

// The service implementation
class NavigationSystem(IGpsSensor sensor) : INavigationSystem
{
    public void Navigate()
    {
        // Navigation logic using the sensor...
    }
}

// The consumer of the abstraction
partial class VehicleComputer(INavigationSystem navigationSystem)
{
    public void StartTrip() => navigationSystem.Navigate();
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)

Usually the biggest block in the setup is the chain of bindings, which describes which implementation corresponds to which abstraction. This is necessary so that the code generator can build a composition of objects using only NOT abstract types. This is true because the cornerstone of DI technology implementation is the principle of abstraction-based programming rather than concrete class-based programming. Thanks to it, it is possible to replace one concrete implementation by another. And each implementation can correspond to an arbitrary number of abstractions.
> [!TIP]
> Even if the binding is not defined, there is no problem with the injection, but obviously under the condition that the consumer requests an injection NOT of abstract type.


## Composition roots

This example demonstrates several ways to create a composition root.
> [!TIP]
> There is no limit to the number of roots, but you should consider limiting the number of roots. Ideally, an application should have a single composition root.

If you use classic DI containers, the composition is resolved dynamically every time you call a method similar to `T Resolve<T>()` or `object GetService(Type type)`. The root of the composition there is simply the root type of the composition of objects in memory `T` or `Type` type. There can be as many of these as you like. In the case of Pure.DI, the number of composition roots is limited because for each composition root a separate property or method is created at compile time. Therefore, each root is defined explicitly by calling the `Root(string rootName)` method.

```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IInvoiceGenerator>().To<PdfInvoiceGenerator>()
    .Bind<IInvoiceGenerator>("Online").To<HtmlInvoiceGenerator>()
    .Bind<ILogger>().To<FileLogger>()

    // Specifies to create a regular composition root
    // of type "IInvoiceGenerator" with the name "InvoiceGenerator".
    // This will be the main entry point for invoice generation.
    .Root<IInvoiceGenerator>("InvoiceGenerator")

    // Specifies to create an anonymous composition root
    // that is only accessible from "Resolve()" methods.
    // This is useful for auxiliary types or testing.
    .Root<ILogger>()

    // Specifies to create a regular composition root
    // of type "IInvoiceGenerator" with the name "OnlineInvoiceGenerator"
    // using the "Online" tag to differentiate implementations.
    .Root<IInvoiceGenerator>("OnlineInvoiceGenerator", "Online");

var composition = new Composition();

// Resolves the default invoice generator (PDF) with all its dependencies
// invoiceGenerator = new PdfInvoiceGenerator(new FileLogger());
var invoiceGenerator = composition.InvoiceGenerator;

// Resolves the online invoice generator (HTML)
// onlineInvoiceGenerator = new HtmlInvoiceGenerator();
var onlineInvoiceGenerator = composition.OnlineInvoiceGenerator;

// All and only the roots of the composition
// can be obtained by Resolve method.
// Here we resolve the private root 'ILogger'.
var logger = composition.Resolve<ILogger>();

// We can also resolve tagged roots dynamically if needed
var tagged = composition.Resolve<IInvoiceGenerator>("Online");

// Common logger interface used across the system
interface ILogger;

// Concrete implementation of a logger that writes to a file
class FileLogger : ILogger;

// Abstract definition of an invoice generator
interface IInvoiceGenerator;

// Implementation for generating PDF invoices, dependent on ILogger
class PdfInvoiceGenerator(ILogger logger) : IInvoiceGenerator;

// Implementation for generating HTML invoices for online viewing
class HtmlInvoiceGenerator : IInvoiceGenerator;
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)

The name of the composition root is arbitrarily chosen depending on its purpose but should be restricted by the property naming conventions in C# since it is the same name as a property in the composition class. In reality, the _Root_ property has the form:
```c#
public IService Root
{
  get
  {
    return new Service(new Dependency());
  }
}
```
To avoid generating _Resolve_ methods just add a comment `// Resolve = Off` before a _Setup_ method:
```c#
// Resolve = Off
DI.Setup("Composition")
  .Bind<IDependency>().To<Dependency>()
  ...
```
This can be done if these methods are not needed, in case only certain composition roots are used. It's not significant then, but it will help save resources during compilation.

## Resolve methods

This example shows how to resolve the roots of a composition using `Resolve` methods to use the composition as a _Service Locator_. The `Resolve` methods are generated automatically without additional effort.

```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IDevice>().To<Device>()
    .Bind<ISensor>().To<TemperatureSensor>()
    .Bind<ISensor>("Humidity").To<HumiditySensor>()

    // Specifies to create a private root
    // that is only accessible from _Resolve_ methods
    .Root<ISensor>()

    // Specifies to create a public root named _HumiditySensor_
    // using the "Humidity" tag
    .Root<ISensor>("HumiditySensor", "Humidity");

var composition = new Composition();

// The next 3 lines of code do the same thing:
var sensor1 = composition.Resolve<ISensor>();
var sensor2 = composition.Resolve(typeof(ISensor));
var sensor3 = composition.Resolve(typeof(ISensor), null);

// Resolve by "Humidity" tag
// The next 3 lines of code do the same thing too:
var humiditySensor1 = composition.Resolve<ISensor>("Humidity");
var humiditySensor2 = composition.Resolve(typeof(ISensor), "Humidity");
var humiditySensor3 = composition.HumiditySensor; // Gets the composition through the public root

interface IDevice;

class Device : IDevice;

interface ISensor;

class TemperatureSensor(IDevice device) : ISensor;

class HumiditySensor : ISensor;
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)

_Resolve_ methods are similar to calls to composition roots. Composition roots are properties (or methods). Their use is efficient and does not cause exceptions. This is why they are recommended to be used. In contrast, _Resolve_ methods have a number of disadvantages:
- They provide access to an unlimited set of dependencies (_Service Locator_).
- Their use can potentially lead to runtime exceptions. For example, when the corresponding root has not been defined.
- Sometimes cannot be used directly, e.g., for MAUI/WPF/Avalonia binding.

## Simplified binding

You can use the `Bind(...)` method without type parameters. In this case binding will be performed for the implementation type itself, and if the implementation is not an abstract type or structure, for all abstract but NOT special types that are directly implemented.

```c#
using System.Collections;
using Pure.DI;

// Specifies to create a partial class "Composition"
DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Begins the binding definition for the implementation type itself,
    // and if the implementation is not an abstract class or structure,
    // for all abstract but NOT special types that are directly implemented.
    // So that's the equivalent of the following:
    // .Bind<IOrderRepository, IOrderNotification, OrderManager>()
    //   .As(Lifetime.PerBlock)
    //   .To<OrderManager>()
    .Bind().As(Lifetime.PerBlock).To<OrderManager>()
    .Bind().To<Shop>()

    // Specifies to create a property "MyShop"
    .Root<IShop>("MyShop");

var composition = new Composition();
var shop = composition.MyShop;

interface IManager;

class ManagerBase : IManager;

interface IOrderRepository;

interface IOrderNotification;

class OrderManager :
    ManagerBase,
    IOrderRepository,
    IOrderNotification,
    IDisposable,
    IEnumerable<string>
{
    public void Dispose() {}

    public IEnumerator<string> GetEnumerator() =>
        new List<string> { "Order #1", "Order #2" }.GetEnumerator();

    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() => GetEnumerator();
}

interface IShop;

class Shop(
    OrderManager manager,
    IOrderRepository repository,
    IOrderNotification notification)
    : IShop;
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)

As practice has shown, in most cases it is possible to define abstraction types in bindings automatically. That's why we added API `Bind()` method without type parameters to define abstractions in bindings. It is the `Bind()` method that performs the binding:

- with the implementation type itself
- and if it is NOT an abstract type or structure
  - with all abstract types that it directly implements
  - exceptions are special types

Special types will not be added to bindings:

- `System.Object`
- `System.Enum`
- `System.MulticastDelegate`
- `System.Delegate`
- `System.Collections.IEnumerable`
- `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>`
- `System.Collections.Generic.IList<T>`
- `System.Collections.Generic.ICollection<T>`
- `System.Collections.IEnumerator`
- `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator<T>`
- `System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<T>`
- `System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyCollection<T>`
- `System.IDisposable`
- `System.IAsyncResult`
- `System.AsyncCallback`

For class `OrderManager`, the `Bind().To<OrderManager>()` binding will be equivalent to the `Bind<IOrderRepository, IOrderNotification, OrderManager>().To<OrderManager>()` binding. The types `IDisposable`, `IEnumerable<string>` did not get into the binding because they are special from the list above. `ManagerBase` did not get into the binding because it is not abstract. `IManager` is not included because it is not implemented directly by class `OrderManager`.

|    |                       |                                                   |
|----|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ | `OrderManager`        | implementation type itself                        |
| ✅ | `IOrderRepository`    | directly implements                               |
| ✅ | `IOrderNotification`  | directly implements                               |
| ❌ | `IDisposable`         | special type                                      |
| ❌ | `IEnumerable<string>` | special type                                      |
| ❌ | `ManagerBase`         | non-abstract                                      |
| ❌ | `IManager`            | is not directly implemented by class OrderManager |

## Factory

This example demonstrates how to create and initialize an instance manually. At the compilation stage, the set of dependencies that the object to be created needs is determined. In most cases, this happens automatically, according to the set of constructors and their arguments, and does not require additional customization efforts. But sometimes it is necessary to manually create and/or initialize an object, as in lines of code:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IDatabaseService>().To<DatabaseService>(ctx => {
        // Some logic for creating an instance.
        // For example, we need to manually initialize the connection.
        ctx.Inject(out DatabaseService service);
        service.Connect();
        return service;
    })
    .Bind<IUserRegistry>().To<UserRegistry>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IUserRegistry>("Registry");

var composition = new Composition();
var registry = composition.Registry;
registry.Database.IsConnected.ShouldBeTrue();

interface IDatabaseService
{
    bool IsConnected { get; }
}

class DatabaseService : IDatabaseService
{
    public bool IsConnected { get; private set; }

    // Simulates a connection establishment that must be called explicitly
    public void Connect() => IsConnected = true;
}

interface IUserRegistry
{
    IDatabaseService Database { get; }
}

class UserRegistry(IDatabaseService database) : IUserRegistry
{
    public IDatabaseService Database { get; } = database;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

There are scenarios where manual control over the creation process is required, such as
- When additional initialization logic is needed
- When complex construction steps are required
- When specific object states need to be set during creation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The method `Inject()`cannot be used outside of the binding setup.

## Simplified factory

This example shows how to create and initialize an instance manually in a simplified form. When you use a lambda function to specify custom instance initialization logic, each parameter of that function represents an injection of a dependency. Starting with C# 10, you can also put the `Tag(...)` attribute in front of the parameter to specify the tag of the injected dependency.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind("today").To(_ => DateTime.Today)
    // Injects FileLogger and DateTime instances
    // and performs further initialization logic
    // defined in the lambda function to set up the log file name
    .Bind<IFileLogger>().To((
        FileLogger logger,
        [Tag("today")] DateTime date) => {
        logger.Init($"app-{date:yyyy-MM-dd}.log");
        return logger;
    })
    .Bind().To<OrderProcessingService>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IOrderProcessingService>("OrderService");

var composition = new Composition();
var service = composition.OrderService;

service.Logger.FileName.ShouldBe($"app-{DateTime.Today:yyyy-MM-dd}.log");

interface IFileLogger
{
    string FileName { get; }

    void Log(string message);
}

class FileLogger : IFileLogger
{
    public string FileName { get; private set; } = "";

    public void Init(string fileName) => FileName = fileName;

    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Write to file
    }
}

interface IOrderProcessingService
{
    IFileLogger Logger { get; }
}

class OrderProcessingService(IFileLogger logger) : IOrderProcessingService
{
    public IFileLogger Logger { get; } = logger;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

The example creates a `service` that depends on a `logger` initialized with a specific file name based on the current date. The `Tag` attribute allows specifying named dependencies for more complex scenarios.

## Injection on demand

This example demonstrates using dependency injection with Pure.DI to dynamically create dependencies as needed via a factory function. The code defines a service (`GameLevel`) that requires multiple instances of a dependency (`Enemy`). Instead of injecting pre-created instances, the service receives a `Func<IEnemy>` factory delegate, allowing it to generate entities on demand.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using System.Collections.Generic;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind().To<Enemy>()
    .Bind().To<GameLevel>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IGameLevel>("GameLevel");

var composition = new Composition();
var gameLevel = composition.GameLevel;

// Verifies that two distinct enemies have been spawned
gameLevel.Enemies.Count.ShouldBe(2);

// Represents a game entity that acts as an enemy
interface IEnemy;

class Enemy : IEnemy;

// Represents a game level that manages entities
interface IGameLevel
{
    IReadOnlyList<IEnemy> Enemies { get; }
}

class GameLevel(Func<IEnemy> enemySpawner) : IGameLevel
{
    // The factory acts as a "spawner" to create new enemy instances on demand.
    // Calling 'enemySpawner()' creates a fresh instance of Enemy each time.
    public IReadOnlyList<IEnemy> Enemies { get; } =
    [
        enemySpawner(),
        enemySpawner()
    ];
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

Key elements:
- `Enemy` is bound to the `IEnemy` interface, and `GameLevel` is bound to `IGameLevel`.
- The `GameLevel` constructor accepts `Func<IEnemy>`, enabling deferred creation of entities.
- The `GameLevel` calls the factory twice, resulting in two distinct `Enemy` instances stored in its `Enemies` collection.

This approach showcases how factories can control dependency lifetime and instance creation timing in a DI container. The Pure.DI configuration ensures the factory resolves new `IEnemy` instances each time it's invoked, achieving "injections as required" functionality.

## Injections on demand with arguments

This example illustrates dependency injection with parameterized factory functions using Pure.DI, where dependencies are created with runtime-provided arguments. The scenario features a service that generates dependencies with specific IDs passed during instantiation.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using System.Collections.Generic;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind().To<Sensor>()
    .Bind().To<SmartHome>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<ISmartHome>("SmartHome");

var composition = new Composition();
var smartHome = composition.SmartHome;
var sensors = smartHome.Sensors;

sensors.Count.ShouldBe(2);
sensors[0].Id.ShouldBe(101);
sensors[1].Id.ShouldBe(102);

interface ISensor
{
    int Id { get; }
}

class Sensor(int id) : ISensor
{
    public int Id { get; } = id;
}

interface ISmartHome
{
    IReadOnlyList<ISensor> Sensors { get; }
}

class SmartHome(Func<int, ISensor> sensorFactory) : ISmartHome
{
    public IReadOnlyList<ISensor> Sensors { get; } =
    [
        // Use the injected factory to create a sensor with ID 101 (e.g., Kitchen Temperature)
        sensorFactory(101),

        // Create another sensor with ID 102 (e.g., Living Room Humidity)
        sensorFactory(102)
    ];
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

Delayed dependency instantiation:
- Injection of dependencies requiring runtime parameters
- Creation of distinct instances with different configurations
- Type-safe resolution of dependencies with constructor arguments

## Composition arguments

Sometimes you need to pass some state to a composition class to use it when resolving dependencies. To do this, just use the `Arg<T>(string argName)` method, specify the type of argument and its name. You can also specify a tag for each argument. You can then use them as dependencies when building the object graph. If you have multiple arguments of the same type, just use tags to distinguish them. The values of the arguments are manipulated when you create a composition class by calling its constructor. It is important to remember that only those arguments that are used in the object graph will appear in the constructor. Arguments that are not involved will not be added to the constructor arguments.
> [!NOTE]
> Actually, composition arguments work like normal bindings. The difference is that they bind to the values of the arguments. These values will be injected wherever they are required.


```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IBankGateway>().To<BankGateway>()
    .Bind<IPaymentProcessor>().To<PaymentProcessor>()

    // Composition root "PaymentService"
    .Root<IPaymentProcessor>("PaymentService")

    // Composition argument: Connection timeout (e.g., from config)
    .Arg<int>("timeoutSeconds")

    // Composition argument: API Token (using a tag to distinguish from other strings)
    .Arg<string>("authToken", "api token")

    // Composition argument: Bank gateway address
    .Arg<string>("gatewayUrl");

// Create the composition, passing real settings from "outside"
var composition = new Composition(
    timeoutSeconds: 30,
    authToken: "secret_token_123",
    gatewayUrl: "https://api.bank.com/v1");

var paymentService = composition.PaymentService;

paymentService.Token.ShouldBe("secret_token_123");
paymentService.Gateway.Timeout.ShouldBe(30);
paymentService.Gateway.Url.ShouldBe("https://api.bank.com/v1");

interface IBankGateway
{
    int Timeout { get; }

    string Url { get; }
}

// Simulation of a bank gateway client
class BankGateway(int timeoutSeconds, string gatewayUrl) : IBankGateway
{
    public int Timeout { get; } = timeoutSeconds;

    public string Url { get; } = gatewayUrl;
}

interface IPaymentProcessor
{
    string Token { get; }

    IBankGateway Gateway { get; }
}

// Payment processing service
class PaymentProcessor(
    // The tag allows specifying exactly which string to inject here
    [Tag("api token")] string token,
    IBankGateway gateway) : IPaymentProcessor
{
    public string Token { get; } = token;

    public IBankGateway Gateway { get; } = gateway;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Root arguments

Sometimes it is necessary to pass some state to the composition to use it when resolving dependencies. To do this, just use the `RootArg<T>(string argName)` method, specify the type of argument and its name. You can also specify a tag for each argument. You can then use them as dependencies when building the object graph. If you have multiple arguments of the same type, just use tags to distinguish them. The root of a composition that uses at least one root argument is prepended as a method, not a property. It is important to remember that the method will only display arguments that are used in the object graph of that composition root. Arguments that are not involved will not be added to the method arguments. It is best to use unique argument names so that there are no collisions.
> [!NOTE]
> Actually, root arguments work like normal bindings. The difference is that they bind to the values of the arguments. These values will be injected wherever they are required.


```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Tag;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // This hint indicates to not generate methods such as Resolve
    .Hint(Hint.Resolve, "Off")
    .Bind<IDatabaseService>().To<DatabaseService>()
    .Bind<IApplication>().To<Application>()

    // Root arguments serve as values passed
    // to the composition root method
    .RootArg<int>("port")
    .RootArg<string>("connectionString")

    // An argument can be tagged
    // to be injectable by type and this tag
    .RootArg<string>("appName", AppDetail)

    // Composition root
    .Root<IApplication>("CreateApplication");

var composition = new Composition();

// Creates an application with specific arguments
var app = composition.CreateApplication(
    appName: "MySuperApp",
    port: 8080,
    connectionString: "Server=.;Database=MyDb;");

app.Name.ShouldBe("MySuperApp");
app.Database.Port.ShouldBe(8080);
app.Database.ConnectionString.ShouldBe("Server=.;Database=MyDb;");

interface IDatabaseService
{
    int Port { get; }

    string ConnectionString { get; }
}

class DatabaseService(int port, string connectionString) : IDatabaseService
{
    public int Port { get; } = port;

    public string ConnectionString { get; } = connectionString;
}

interface IApplication
{
    string Name { get; }

    IDatabaseService Database { get; }
}

class Application(
    [Tag(AppDetail)] string name,
    IDatabaseService database)
    : IApplication
{
    public string Name { get; } = name;

    public IDatabaseService Database { get; } = database;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

When using composition root arguments, compilation warnings are shown if `Resolve` methods are generated, since these methods will not be able to create these roots. You can disable the creation of `Resolve` methods using the `Hint(Hint.Resolve, "Off")` hint, or ignore them but remember the risks of using `Resolve` methods.

## Tags

Sometimes it's important to take control of building a dependency graph. For example, when there are different implementations of the same interface. In this case, _tags_ will help:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // The `default` tag is used to resolve dependencies
    // when the tag was not specified by the consumer
    .Bind<IApiClient>("Public", default).To<RestApiClient>()
    .Bind<IApiClient>("Internal").As(Lifetime.Singleton).To<InternalApiClient>()
    .Bind<IApiFacade>().To<ApiFacade>()

    // "InternalRoot" is a root name, "Internal" is a tag
    .Root<IApiClient>("InternalRoot", "Internal")

    // Specifies to create the composition root named "Root"
    .Root<IApiFacade>("Api");

var composition = new Composition();
var api = composition.Api;
api.PublicClient.ShouldBeOfType<RestApiClient>();
api.InternalClient.ShouldBeOfType<InternalApiClient>();
api.InternalClient.ShouldBe(composition.InternalRoot);
api.DefaultClient.ShouldBeOfType<RestApiClient>();

interface IApiClient;

class RestApiClient : IApiClient;

class InternalApiClient : IApiClient;

interface IApiFacade
{
    IApiClient PublicClient { get; }

    IApiClient InternalClient { get; }

    IApiClient DefaultClient { get; }
}

class ApiFacade(
    [Tag("Public")] IApiClient publicClient,
    [Tag("Internal")] IApiClient internalClient,
    IApiClient defaultClient)
    : IApiFacade
{
    public IApiClient PublicClient { get; } = publicClient;

    public IApiClient InternalClient { get; } = internalClient;

    public IApiClient DefaultClient { get; } = defaultClient;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

The example shows how to:
- Define multiple bindings for the same interface
- Use tags to differentiate between implementations
- Control lifetime management
- Inject tagged dependencies into constructors

The tag can be a constant, a type, a [smart tag](smart-tags.md), or a value of an `Enum` type. The _default_ and _null_ tags are also supported.

## Smart tags

When you have a large graph of objects, you may need a lot of tags to neatly define all the dependencies in it. Strings or other constant values are not always convenient to use, because they have too much variability. And there are often cases when you specify one tag in the binding, but the same tag in the dependency, but with a typo, which leads to a compilation error when checking the dependency graph. The solution to this problem is to create an `Enum` type and use its values as tags. Pure.DI makes it easier to solve this problem.

When you specify a tag in a binding and the compiler can't determine what that value is, Pure.DI will automatically create a constant for it inside the `Pure.DI.Tag` type. For the example below, the set of constants would look like this:

```c#
namespace Pure.DI
{
  internal partial class Tag
  {
    public const string Abc = "Abc";
    public const string Xyz = "Xyz";
  }
}
```
So you can apply refactoring in the development environment. And also tag changes in bindings will be automatically checked by the compiler. This will reduce the number of errors.

![](smart_tags.gif)

The example below also uses the `using static Pure.DI.Tag;` directive to access tags in `Pure.DI.Tag` without specifying a type name:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

using static Pure.DI.Tag;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // The `default` tag is used to resolve dependencies
    // when the tag was not specified by the consumer
    .Bind<IMessageSender>(Email, default).To<EmailSender>()
    .Bind<IMessageSender>(Sms).As(Singleton).To<SmsSender>()
    .Bind<IMessagingService>().To<MessagingService>()

    // "SmsSenderRoot" is root name, Sms is tag
    .Root<IMessageSender>("SmsSenderRoot", Sms)

    // Specifies to create the composition root named "Root"
    .Root<IMessagingService>("MessagingService");

var composition = new Composition();
var messagingService = composition.MessagingService;
messagingService.EmailSender.ShouldBeOfType<EmailSender>();
messagingService.SmsSender.ShouldBeOfType<SmsSender>();
messagingService.SmsSender.ShouldBe(composition.SmsSenderRoot);
messagingService.DefaultSender.ShouldBeOfType<EmailSender>();

interface IMessageSender;

class EmailSender : IMessageSender;

class SmsSender : IMessageSender;

interface IMessagingService
{
    IMessageSender EmailSender { get; }

    IMessageSender SmsSender { get; }

    IMessageSender DefaultSender { get; }
}

class MessagingService(
    [Tag(Email)] IMessageSender emailSender,
    [Tag(Sms)] IMessageSender smsSender,
    IMessageSender defaultSender)
    : IMessagingService
{
    public IMessageSender EmailSender { get; } = emailSender;

    public IMessageSender SmsSender { get; } = smsSender;

    public IMessageSender DefaultSender { get; } = defaultSender;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Transient

The _Transient_ lifetime specifies to create a new dependency instance each time. It is the default lifetime and can be omitted.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind().As(Transient).To<Buffer>()
    .Bind().To<BatchProcessor>()
    .Root<IBatchProcessor>("Processor");

var composition = new Composition();
var processor = composition.Processor;

// Verify that input and output buffers are different instances.
// This is critical for the batch processor to avoid data corruption
// during reading. The Transient lifetime ensures a new instance
// is created for each dependency injection.
processor.Input.ShouldNotBe(processor.Output);

// Represents a memory buffer that should be unique for each operation
interface IBuffer;

class Buffer : IBuffer;

interface IBatchProcessor
{
    public IBuffer Input { get; }

    public IBuffer Output { get; }
}

class BatchProcessor(
    IBuffer input,
    IBuffer output)
    : IBatchProcessor
{
    public IBuffer Input { get; } = input;

    public IBuffer Output { get; } = output;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

The _Transient_ lifetime is the safest and is used by default. Yes, its widespread use can cause a lot of memory traffic, but if there are doubts about thread safety, the _Transient_ lifetime is preferable because each consumer has its own instance of the dependency. The following nuances should be considered when choosing the _Transient_ lifetime:

- There will be unnecessary memory overhead that could be avoided.

- Every object created must be disposed of, and this will waste CPU resources, at least when the GC does its memory-clearing job.

- Poorly designed constructors can run slowly, perform functions that are not their own, and greatly hinder the efficient creation of compositions of multiple objects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following very important rule, in my opinion, will help in the last point. Now, when a constructor is used to implement dependencies, it should not be loaded with other tasks. Accordingly, constructors should be free of all logic except for checking arguments and saving them for later use. Following this rule, even the largest compositions of objects will be built quickly.

## Singleton

The _Singleton_ lifetime ensures that there will be a single instance of the dependency for each composition.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Bind the cache as Singleton to share it across all services
    .Bind().As(Singleton).To<Cache>()
    // Bind the order service as Transient (default) for per-request instances
    .Bind().To<OrderService>()
    .Root<IOrderService>("OrderService");

var composition = new Composition();
var orderService1 = composition.OrderService; // First order service instance
var orderService2 = composition.OrderService; // Second order service instance

// Verify that both services share the same cache instance (Singleton behavior)
orderService1.Cache.ShouldBe(orderService2.Cache);
// Simulate real-world usage: add data to cache via one service and check via another
orderService1.AddToCache("Order123", "Processed");
orderService2.GetFromCache("Order123").ShouldBe("Processed");

// Interface for a shared cache (e.g., for storing order statuses)
interface ICache
{
    void Add(string key, string value);

    bool TryGet(string key, [MaybeNullWhen(false)] out string value);
}

// Implementation of a simple in-memory cache (must be thread-safe in real apps)
class Cache : ICache
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, string> _data = new();

    public void Add(string key, string value) =>
        _data[key] = value;

    public bool TryGet(string key, [MaybeNullWhen(false)] out string value) =>
        _data.TryGetValue(key, out value);
}

// Interface for order processing service
interface IOrderService
{
    ICache Cache { get; }

    void AddToCache(string orderId, string status);

    string GetFromCache(string orderId);
}

// Order service that uses the shared cache
class OrderService(ICache cache) : IOrderService
{
    // The cache is injected and shared (Singleton)
    public ICache Cache { get; } = cache;

    // Real-world method: add order status to cache
    public void AddToCache(string orderId, string status) =>
        Cache.Add(orderId, status);

    // Real-world method: retrieve order status from cache
    public string GetFromCache(string orderId) =>
        Cache.TryGet(orderId, out var status) ? status : "unknown";
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

Some articles advise using objects with a _Singleton_ lifetime as often as possible, but the following details must be considered:

- For .NET the default behavior is to create a new instance of the type each time it is needed, other behavior requires, additional logic that is not free and requires additional resources.

- The use of _Singleton_, adds a requirement for thread-safety controls on their use, since singletons are more likely to share their state between different threads without even realizing it.

- The thread-safety control should be automatically extended to all dependencies that _Singleton_ uses, since their state is also now shared.

- Logic for thread-safety control can be resource-costly, error-prone, interlocking, and difficult to test.

- _Singleton_ can retain dependency references longer than their expected lifetime, this is especially significant for objects that hold "non-renewable" resources, such as the operating system Handler.

- Sometimes additional logic is required to dispose of _Singleton_.

## PerResolve

The _PerResolve_ lifetime ensures that there will be one instance of the dependency for each composition root instance.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // PerResolve = one "planning session" per root access.
    // Imagine: each time you ask for a plan, you get a fresh context.
    .Bind().As(PerResolve).To<RoutePlanningSession>()

    // Singleton = created once per Composition instance.
    // Here it intentionally captures session when it's created the first time
    // (this is a realistic pitfall: singleton accidentally holds request-scoped state).
    .Bind().As(Singleton).To<(IRoutePlanningSession s3, IRoutePlanningSession s4)>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<TrainTripPlanner>("Planner");

var composition = new Composition();

// First "user request": plan a trip now
var plan1 = composition.Planner;

// In the same request, PerResolve dependencies are the same instance:
plan1.SessionForOutbound.ShouldBe(plan1.SessionForReturn);

// Tuple is Singleton, so both entries are the same captured instance:
plan1.CapturedSessionA.ShouldBe(plan1.CapturedSessionB);

// Because the singleton tuple was created during the first request,
// it captured THAT request's PerResolve session:
plan1.SessionForOutbound.ShouldBe(plan1.CapturedSessionA);

// Second "user request": plan another trip (new root access)
var plan2 = composition.Planner;

// New request => new PerResolve session:
plan2.SessionForOutbound.ShouldNotBe(plan1.SessionForOutbound);

// But the singleton still holds the old captured session from the first request:
plan2.CapturedSessionA.ShouldBe(plan1.CapturedSessionA);
plan2.SessionForOutbound.ShouldNotBe(plan2.CapturedSessionA);

// A request-scoped context: e.g., contains "now", locale, pricing rules version,
// feature flags, etc. You typically want a new one per route planning request.
interface IRoutePlanningSession;

class RoutePlanningSession : IRoutePlanningSession;

// A service that plans a train trip.
// It asks for two session instances to demonstrate PerResolve:
// both should be the same within a single request.
class TrainTripPlanner(
    IRoutePlanningSession sessionForOutbound,
    IRoutePlanningSession sessionForReturn,
    (IRoutePlanningSession capturedA, IRoutePlanningSession capturedB) capturedSessions)
{
    public IRoutePlanningSession SessionForOutbound { get; } = sessionForOutbound;

    public IRoutePlanningSession SessionForReturn { get; } = sessionForReturn;

    // These come from a singleton tuple — effectively "global cached" instances.
    public IRoutePlanningSession CapturedSessionA { get; } = capturedSessions.capturedA;

    public IRoutePlanningSession CapturedSessionB { get; } = capturedSessions.capturedB;
}
```

 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## PerBlock

The _PreBlock_ lifetime does not guarantee that there will be a single dependency instance for each instance of the composition root (as for the _PreResolve_ lifetime), but is useful for reducing the number of instances of a type.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Bind DatabaseConnection with PerBlock lifetime:
    // Ensures a single connection per composition root (e.g., per user request),
    // but a new one for each new root - useful for batch operations without full singleton overhead.
    .Bind().As(PerBlock).To<DatabaseConnection>()
    // Bind a tuple of two connections as Singleton:
    // This shares the same connection globally, simulating a cached or shared resource.
    .Bind().As(Singleton).To<(IDatabaseConnection conn3, IDatabaseConnection conn4)>()

    // Composition root - represents the main service entry point.
    .Root<OrderRepository>("Repository");

var composition = new Composition();

// Simulate the first user request or batch operation
var repository1 = composition.Repository;
repository1.ProcessOrder("ORD-2025-54546");

// Check that within one repository (one block), connections are shared for consistency
repository1.PrimaryConnection.ShouldBe(repository1.SecondaryConnection);
repository1.OtherConnection.ShouldBe(repository1.FallbackConnection);
repository1.PrimaryConnection.ShouldBe(repository1.OtherConnection);

// Simulate the second user request or batch - should have a new PerBlock connection
var repository2 = composition.Repository;
repository2.PrimaryConnection.ShouldNotBe(repository1.PrimaryConnection);

// Interface for database connection - in a real world, this could handle SQL queries
interface IDatabaseConnection;

// Implementation of database connection - transient-like but controlled by lifetime
class DatabaseConnection : IDatabaseConnection;

// Repository for handling orders, injecting multiple connections for demonstration
// In real-world, this could process orders in a batch, sharing connection within the batch
class OrderRepository(
    IDatabaseConnection primaryConnection,
    IDatabaseConnection secondaryConnection,
    (IDatabaseConnection otherConnection, IDatabaseConnection fallbackConnection) additionalConnections)
{
    // Public properties for connections - in practice, these would be private and used in methods
    public IDatabaseConnection PrimaryConnection { get; } = primaryConnection;

    public IDatabaseConnection SecondaryConnection { get; } = secondaryConnection;

    public IDatabaseConnection OtherConnection { get; } = additionalConnections.otherConnection;

    public IDatabaseConnection FallbackConnection { get; } = additionalConnections.fallbackConnection;

    // Example real-world method: Process an order using the shared connection
    public void ProcessOrder(string orderId)
    {
        // Use PrimaryConnection to query database, e.g.,
        // "SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Id = @orderId"
    }
}
```

 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Scope

The _Scoped_ lifetime ensures that there will be a single instance of the dependency for each scope.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

var composition = new Composition();
var app = composition.AppRoot;

// Real-world analogy:
// each HTTP request (or message consumer handling) creates its own scope.
// Scoped services live exactly as long as the request is being processed.

// Request #1
var request1 = app.CreateRequestScope();
var checkout1 = request1.RequestRoot;

var ctx11 = checkout1.Context;
var ctx12 = checkout1.Context;

// Same request => same scoped instance
ctx11.ShouldBe(ctx12);

// Request #2
var request2 = app.CreateRequestScope();
var checkout2 = request2.RequestRoot;

var ctx2 = checkout2.Context;

// Different request => different scoped instance
ctx11.ShouldNotBe(ctx2);

// End of Request #1 => scoped instance is disposed
request1.Dispose();
ctx11.IsDisposed.ShouldBeTrue();

// End of Request #2 => scoped instance is disposed
request2.Dispose();
ctx2.IsDisposed.ShouldBeTrue();

interface IRequestContext
{
    Guid CorrelationId { get; }

    bool IsDisposed { get; }
}

// Typically: DbContext / UnitOfWork / RequestTelemetry / Activity, etc.
sealed class RequestContext : IRequestContext, IDisposable
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; } = Guid.NewGuid();

    public bool IsDisposed { get; private set; }

    public void Dispose() => IsDisposed = true;
}

interface ICheckoutService
{
    IRequestContext Context { get; }
}

// "Controller/service" that participates in request processing.
// It depends on a scoped context (per-request resource).
sealed class CheckoutService(IRequestContext context) : ICheckoutService
{
    public IRequestContext Context => context;
}

// Implements a request scope (per-request container)
sealed class RequestScope(Composition parent) : Composition(parent);

partial class App(Func<RequestScope> requestScopeFactory)
{
    // In a web app this would roughly map to: "create scope for request"
    public RequestScope CreateRequestScope() => requestScopeFactory();
}

partial class Composition
{
    static void Setup() =>

        DI.Setup()
            // Per-request lifetime
            .Bind().As(Scoped).To<RequestContext>()

            // Regular service that consumes scoped context
            .Bind().To<CheckoutService>()

            // "Request root" (what your controller/handler resolves)
            .Root<ICheckoutService>("RequestRoot")

            // "Application root" (what creates request scopes)
            .Root<App>("AppRoot");
}
```

 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Auto scoped

You can use the following example to automatically create a session when creating instances of a particular type:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

var composition = new Composition();
var musicApp = composition.MusicAppRoot;

// Session #1: user starts listening on "Living Room Speaker"
var session1 = musicApp.StartListeningSession();
session1.Enqueue("Daft Punk - One More Time");
session1.Enqueue("Massive Attack - Teardrop");

// Session #2: user starts listening on "Headphones"
var session2 = musicApp.StartListeningSession();
session2.Enqueue("Radiohead - Weird Fishes/Arpeggi");

// Different sessions -> different scoped queue instances
session1.Queue.ShouldNotBe(session2.Queue);

// But inside one session, the same queue is used everywhere within that scope
session1.Queue.Items.Count.ShouldBe(2);
session2.Queue.Items.Count.ShouldBe(1);

// Domain abstractions

interface IPlaybackQueue
{
    IReadOnlyList<string> Items { get; }
    void Add(string trackTitle);
}

sealed class PlaybackQueue : IPlaybackQueue
{
    private readonly List<string> _items = [];

    public IReadOnlyList<string> Items => _items;

    public void Add(string trackTitle) => _items.Add(trackTitle);
}

interface IListeningSession
{
    IPlaybackQueue Queue { get; }

    void Enqueue(string trackTitle);
}

sealed class ListeningSession(IPlaybackQueue queue) : IListeningSession
{
    public IPlaybackQueue Queue => queue;

    public void Enqueue(string trackTitle) => queue.Add(trackTitle);
}

// Implements a "session boundary" for listening
class MusicApp(Func<IListeningSession> sessionFactory)
{
    // Each call creates a new DI scope under the hood (new "listening session").
    public IListeningSession StartListeningSession() => sessionFactory();
}

partial class Composition
{
    static void Setup() =>

        DI.Setup()
            // Scoped: one queue per listening session
            .Bind().As(Scoped).To<PlaybackQueue>()

            // Session composition root (private root used only to build sessions)
            .Root<ListeningSession>("Session", kind: RootKinds.Private)

            // Auto scoped factory: creates a new scope for each listening session
            .Bind().To(IListeningSession (Composition parentScope) => {
                // Create a child scope so scoped services (PlaybackQueue) are unique per session.
                var scope = new Composition(parentScope);
                return scope.Session;
            })

            // App-level root
            .Root<MusicApp>("MusicAppRoot");
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The method `Inject()`cannot be used outside of the binding setup.

## Default lifetime

For example, if some lifetime is used more often than others, you can make it the default lifetime:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // In real AI apps, the "client" (HTTP handler, connection pool, retries, telemetry)
    // is typically expensive and should be shared.
    //
    // DefaultLifetime(Singleton) makes *all* bindings in this chain singletons,
    // until the chain ends or DefaultLifetime(...) is called again.
    .DefaultLifetime(Singleton)
    .Bind().To<LlmGateway>()
    .Bind().To<RagChatAssistant>()
    .Root<IChatAssistant>("Assistant");

var composition = new Composition();

// Think of these as two independent "requests" to resolve the assistant.
// With singleton lifetime, you get the same assistant instance each time.
var assistant1 = composition.Assistant;
var assistant2 = composition.Assistant;

assistant1.ShouldBe(assistant2);

// The assistant depends on the same gateway in two places (e.g., chat + embeddings).
// Because the gateway is singleton, both references are the *same instance*.
assistant1.ChatGateway.ShouldBe(assistant1.EmbeddingsGateway);

// And because the assistant itself is singleton, it reuses the same gateway across resolutions.
assistant1.ChatGateway.ShouldBe(assistant2.ChatGateway);

// Represents an "LLM provider gateway": HTTP client, auth, retries, rate limiting, etc.
// NOTE: No secrets here; in real projects you'd configure credentials via secure configuration.
interface ILlmGateway;

// Concrete gateway implementation (placeholder for "OpenAI/Anthropic/Azure/etc. client").
class LlmGateway : ILlmGateway;

// A chat assistant that does RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
// It needs the gateway for:
// - Chat completions (answer generation)
// - Embeddings (vectorization of question/documents)
interface IChatAssistant
{
    ILlmGateway ChatGateway { get; }

    ILlmGateway EmbeddingsGateway { get; }
}

class RagChatAssistant(
    ILlmGateway chatGateway,
    ILlmGateway embeddingsGateway)
    : IChatAssistant
{
    public ILlmGateway ChatGateway { get; } = chatGateway;

    public ILlmGateway EmbeddingsGateway { get; } = embeddingsGateway;
}
```

 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Default lifetime for a type

For example, if a certain lifetime is used more often than others, you can make it the default lifetime for a certain type:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // In a real base station, the time source (PTP/GNSS disciplined clock)
    // is a shared infrastructure component:
    // it should be created once per station and reused everywhere.
    .DefaultLifetime<ITimeSource>(Singleton)

    // Time source used by multiple subsystems
    .Bind().To<GnssTimeSource>()

    // Upper-level station components (usually transient by default)
    .Bind().To<BaseStationController>()
    .Bind().To<RadioScheduler>()

    // Composition root (represents "get me a controller instance")
    .Root<IBaseStationController>("Controller");

var composition = new Composition();

// Two independent controller instances (e.g., two independent operations)
var controller1 = composition.Controller;
var controller2 = composition.Controller;

controller1.ShouldNotBe(controller2);

// Inside one controller we request ITimeSource twice:
// the same singleton instance should be injected both times.
controller1.SyncTimeSource.ShouldBe(controller1.SchedulerTimeSource);

// Across different controllers the same station-wide time source is reused.
controller1.SyncTimeSource.ShouldBe(controller2.SyncTimeSource);

// A shared station-wide dependency
interface ITimeSource
{
    long UnixTimeMilliseconds { get; }
}

// Represents a GNSS-disciplined clock (or PTP grandmaster input).
// In real deployments you'd talk to a driver / NIC / daemon here.
class GnssTimeSource : ITimeSource
{
    public long UnixTimeMilliseconds => DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds();
}

interface IBaseStationController
{
    ITimeSource SyncTimeSource { get; }
    ITimeSource SchedulerTimeSource { get; }
}

// A "top-level" controller of the base station.
// It depends on the time source for synchronization and for scheduling decisions.
class BaseStationController(
    ITimeSource syncTimeSource,
    RadioScheduler scheduler)
    : IBaseStationController
{
    // Used for time synchronization / frame timing
    public ITimeSource SyncTimeSource { get; } = syncTimeSource;

    // Demonstrates that scheduler also uses the same singleton time source
    public ITimeSource SchedulerTimeSource { get; } = scheduler.TimeSource;
}

// A subsystem (e.g., MAC scheduler) that also needs precise time.
class RadioScheduler(ITimeSource timeSource)
{
    public ITimeSource TimeSource { get; } = timeSource;
}
```

 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Default lifetime for a type and a tag

For example, if a certain lifetime is used more often than others, you can make it the default lifetime for a certain type:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Real-world idea:
    // "Live" audio capture device should be shared (singleton),
    // while a regular (untagged) audio source can be created per session (transient).
    .DefaultLifetime<IAudioSource>(Singleton, "Live")

    // Tagged binding: "Live" audio capture (shared)
    .Bind("Live").To<LiveAudioSource>()

    // Untagged binding: some other source (new instance each time)
    .Bind().To<BufferedAudioSource>()

    // A playback session uses two sources:
    // - Live (shared, tagged)
    // - Buffered (transient, untagged)
    .Bind().To<PlaybackSession>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IPlaybackSession>("PlaybackSession");

var composition = new Composition();

// Two independent sessions (transient root)
var session1 = composition.PlaybackSession;
var session2 = composition.PlaybackSession;

session1.ShouldNotBe(session2);

// Within a single session:
// - Live source is tagged => default lifetime forces it to be shared (singleton)
// - Buffered source is untagged => transient => always a new instance
session1.LiveSource.ShouldNotBe(session1.BufferedSource);

// Between sessions:
// - Live source is a shared singleton (same instance)
// - Buffered source is transient (different instances)
session1.LiveSource.ShouldBe(session2.LiveSource);

interface IAudioSource;

// "Live" device: e.g., microphone/line-in capture.
class LiveAudioSource : IAudioSource;

// "Buffered" source: e.g., decoded audio chunks, per-session pipeline buffer.
class BufferedAudioSource : IAudioSource;

interface IPlaybackSession
{
    IAudioSource LiveSource { get; }

    IAudioSource BufferedSource { get; }
}

class PlaybackSession(
    // Tagged dependency: should be singleton because of DefaultLifetime<IAudioSource>(..., "Live")
    [Tag("Live")] IAudioSource liveSource,

    // Untagged dependency: transient by default
    IAudioSource bufferedSource)
    : IPlaybackSession
{
    public IAudioSource LiveSource { get; } = liveSource;

    public IAudioSource BufferedSource { get; } = bufferedSource;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Disposable singleton

To dispose all created singleton instances, simply dispose the composition instance:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // This hint indicates to not generate methods such as Resolve
    .Hint(Hint.Resolve, "Off")

    // A realistic example:
    // a submarine has a shared hardware bus to onboard sensors.
    // It should be created once and disposed when the "mission scope"
    // (the composition instance) ends.
    .Bind().As(Singleton).To<AcousticSensorBus>()
    .Bind().To<SubmarineCombatSystem>()
    .Root<ICombatSystem>("CombatSystem");

IAcousticSensorBus bus;
using (var composition = new Composition())
{
    var combatSystem = composition.CombatSystem;

    // Store the singleton instance to verify that it gets disposed
    // when composition is disposed.
    bus = combatSystem.SensorBus;

    // In real usage you would call methods like:
    // combatSystem.ScanForContacts();
}

// When the mission scope ends, all disposable singletons created by it
// must be disposed.
bus.IsDisposed.ShouldBeTrue();

interface IAcousticSensorBus
{
    bool IsDisposed { get; }
}

// Represents a shared connection to submarine sensors (sonar, hydrophones, etc.).
// This is a singleton because the hardware bus is typically a single shared resource,
// and it must be cleaned up properly.
class AcousticSensorBus : IAcousticSensorBus, IDisposable
{
    public bool IsDisposed { get; private set; }

    public void Dispose() => IsDisposed = true;
}

interface ICombatSystem
{
    IAcousticSensorBus SensorBus { get; }
}

// A "combat system" is a typical high-level service that uses shared hardware resources.
class SubmarineCombatSystem(IAcousticSensorBus sensorBus) : ICombatSystem
{
    public IAcousticSensorBus SensorBus { get; } = sensorBus;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

A composition class becomes disposable if it creates at least one disposable singleton instance.

## Async disposable singleton

If at least one of these objects implements the `IAsyncDisposable` interface, then the composition implements `IAsyncDisposable` as well. To dispose of all created singleton instances in an asynchronous manner, simply dispose of the composition instance in an asynchronous manner:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Lifetime;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // A singleton resource that needs async cleanup (e.g., flushing buffers, closing connections)
    .Bind().As(Singleton).To<AuditLogWriter>()
    .Bind().To<CheckoutService>()
    .Root<ICheckoutService>("CheckoutService");

AuditLogWriter writer;

await using (var composition = new Composition())
{
    var service = composition.CheckoutService;

    // A "live" usage: do some work that writes to an audit log
    await service.CheckoutAsync(orderId: "ORD-2025-00042");

    // Keep a reference so we can assert disposal after the composition is disposed
    writer = service.Writer;
    writer.IsDisposed.ShouldBeFalse();
}

// Composition disposal triggers async disposal of singleton(s)
writer.IsDisposed.ShouldBeTrue();

interface ICheckoutService
{
    AuditLogWriter Writer { get; }

    ValueTask CheckoutAsync(string orderId);
}

/// <summary>
/// Represents a singleton infrastructure component.
/// Think: audit log writer, message producer, telemetry pipeline, DB connection, etc.
/// It is owned by the DI container and must be disposed asynchronously.
/// </summary>
sealed class AuditLogWriter : IAsyncDisposable
{
    public bool IsDisposed { get; private set; }

    public async ValueTask WriteAsync(string message)
    {
        ObjectDisposedException.ThrowIf(IsDisposed, nameof(AuditLogWriter));
        // Simulate I/O (writing to file / network / remote log)
        await Task.Delay(5);
    }

    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        // Simulate async cleanup: flush buffers / send remaining events / gracefully close connection
        await Task.Delay(5);
        IsDisposed = true;
    }
}

sealed class CheckoutService(AuditLogWriter writer) : ICheckoutService
{
    public AuditLogWriter Writer { get; } = writer;

    public ValueTask CheckoutAsync(string orderId)
    {
        // Real-world-ish side effect: record a business event
        return Writer.WriteAsync($"Checkout completed: {orderId}");
    }
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Func

_Func<T>_ helps when the logic must enter instances of some type on demand or more than once. This is a very handy mechanism for instance replication. For example it is used when implementing the `Lazy<T>` injection.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using System.Collections.Immutable;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind().As(Lifetime.Singleton).To<TicketIdGenerator>()
    .Bind().To<Ticket>()
    .Bind().To<QueueTerminal>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IQueueTerminal>("Terminal");

var composition = new Composition();
var terminal = composition.Terminal;

terminal.Tickets.Length.ShouldBe(3);

terminal.Tickets[0].Id.ShouldBe(1);
terminal.Tickets[1].Id.ShouldBe(2);
terminal.Tickets[2].Id.ShouldBe(3);

interface ITicketIdGenerator
{
    int NextId { get; }
}

class TicketIdGenerator : ITicketIdGenerator
{
    public int NextId => ++field;
}

interface ITicket
{
    int Id { get; }
}

class Ticket(ITicketIdGenerator idGenerator) : ITicket
{
    public int Id { get; } = idGenerator.NextId;
}

interface IQueueTerminal
{
    ImmutableArray<ITicket> Tickets { get; }
}

class QueueTerminal(Func<ITicket> ticketFactory) : IQueueTerminal
{
    public ImmutableArray<ITicket> Tickets { get; } =
    [
        // The factory creates a new instance of the ticket each time it is called
        ticketFactory(),
        ticketFactory(),
        ticketFactory()
    ];
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

Be careful, replication takes into account the lifetime of the object.

## Enumerable

Specifying `IEnumerable<T>` as the injection type allows you to inject instances of all bindings that implement type `T` in a lazy fashion - the instances will be provided one by one, in order corresponding to the sequence of bindings.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using System.Collections.Immutable;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IMessageSender>().To<EmailSender>()
    .Bind<IMessageSender>("sms").To<SmsSender>()
    .Bind<INotificationService>().To<NotificationService>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<INotificationService>("NotificationService");

var composition = new Composition();
var notificationService = composition.NotificationService;
notificationService.Senders.Length.ShouldBe(2);
notificationService.Senders[0].ShouldBeOfType<EmailSender>();
notificationService.Senders[1].ShouldBeOfType<SmsSender>();

notificationService.Notify("Hello World");

interface IMessageSender
{
    void Send(string message);
}

class EmailSender : IMessageSender
{
    public void Send(string message)
    {
        // Sending email...
    }
}

class SmsSender : IMessageSender
{
    public void Send(string message)
    {
        // Sending SMS...
    }
}

interface INotificationService
{
    ImmutableArray<IMessageSender> Senders { get; }

    void Notify(string message);
}

class NotificationService(IEnumerable<IMessageSender> senders) : INotificationService
{
    public ImmutableArray<IMessageSender> Senders { get; }
        = [..senders];

    public void Notify(string message)
    {
        foreach (var sender in Senders)
        {
            sender.Send(message);
        }
    }
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Enumerable generics

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using System.Collections.Immutable;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Регистрируем обобщенные компоненты middleware.
    // LoggingMiddleware<T> регистрируется как стандартная реализация.
    .Bind<IMiddleware<TT>>().To<LoggingMiddleware<TT>>()
    // MetricsMiddleware<T> регистрируется с тегом "Metrics".
    .Bind<IMiddleware<TT>>("Metrics").To<MetricsMiddleware<TT>>()

    // Регистрируем сам конвейер, который будет принимать коллекцию всех middleware.
    .Bind<IPipeline<TT>>().To<Pipeline<TT>>()

    // Корни композиции для разных типов данных (int и string)
    .Root<IPipeline<int>>("IntPipeline")
    .Root<IPipeline<string>>("StringPipeline");

var composition = new Composition();

// Проверяем конвейер для обработки int
var intPipeline = composition.IntPipeline;
intPipeline.Middlewares.Length.ShouldBe(2);
intPipeline.Middlewares[0].ShouldBeOfType<LoggingMiddleware<int>>();
intPipeline.Middlewares[1].ShouldBeOfType<MetricsMiddleware<int>>();

// Проверяем конвейер для обработки string
var stringPipeline = composition.StringPipeline;
stringPipeline.Middlewares.Length.ShouldBe(2);
stringPipeline.Middlewares[0].ShouldBeOfType<LoggingMiddleware<string>>();
stringPipeline.Middlewares[1].ShouldBeOfType<MetricsMiddleware<string>>();

// Интерфейс для промежуточного ПО (middleware)
interface IMiddleware<T>;

// Реализация для логирования
class LoggingMiddleware<T> : IMiddleware<T>;

// Реализация для сбора метрик
class MetricsMiddleware<T> : IMiddleware<T>;

// Интерфейс конвейера обработки
interface IPipeline<T>
{
    ImmutableArray<IMiddleware<T>> Middlewares { get; }
}

// Реализация конвейера, собирающая все доступные middleware
class Pipeline<T>(IEnumerable<IMiddleware<T>> middlewares) : IPipeline<T>
{
    public ImmutableArray<IMiddleware<T>> Middlewares { get; }
        = [..middlewares];
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Array

Specifying `T[]` as the injection type allows instances from all bindings that implement the `T` type to be injected.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<ISensor>().To<TemperatureSensor>()
    .Bind<ISensor>("External").To<WindSensor>()
    .Bind<ISensorService>().To<SensorService>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<ISensorService>("Sensor");

var composition = new Composition();
var sensor = composition.Sensor;

// Checks that all bindings for the ISensor interface are injected,
// regardless of whether they are tagged or not.
sensor.Sensors.Length.ShouldBe(2);
sensor.Sensors[0].ShouldBeOfType<TemperatureSensor>();
sensor.Sensors[1].ShouldBeOfType<WindSensor>();

interface ISensor;

class TemperatureSensor : ISensor;

class WindSensor : ISensor;

interface ISensorService
{
    ISensor[] Sensors { get; }
}

class SensorService(ISensor[] sensors) : ISensorService
{
    public ISensor[] Sensors { get; } = sensors;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

In addition to arrays, other collection types are also supported, such as:
- System.Memory<T>
- System.ReadOnlyMemory<T>
- System.Span<T>
- System.ReadOnlySpan<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.ICollection<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.IList<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.List<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyCollection<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.ISet<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.HashSet<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.SortedSet<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.Queue<T>
- System.Collections.Generic.Stack<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableArray<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.IImmutableList<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableList<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.IImmutableSet<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableHashSet<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableSortedSet<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.IImmutableQueue<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableQueue<T>
- System.Collections.Immutable.IImmutableStack<T>
And of course this list can easily be supplemented on its own.

## Lazy

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IGraphicsEngine>().To<GraphicsEngine>()
    .Bind<IWindow>().To<Window>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IWindow>("Window");

var composition = new Composition();
var window = composition.Window;

// The graphics engine is created only when it is first accessed
window.Engine.ShouldBe(window.Engine);

interface IGraphicsEngine;

class GraphicsEngine : IGraphicsEngine;

interface IWindow
{
    IGraphicsEngine Engine { get; }
}

class Window(Lazy<IGraphicsEngine> engine) : IWindow
{
    public IGraphicsEngine Engine => engine.Value;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Task

By default, tasks are started automatically when they are injected. It is recommended to use an argument of type <c>CancellationToken</c> to the composition root to be able to cancel the execution of a task. In this case, the composition root property is automatically converted to a method with a parameter of type <c>CancellationToken</c>. To start a task, an instance of type <c>TaskFactory<T></c> is used, with default settings:

- CancellationToken.None
- TaskScheduler.Default
- TaskCreationOptions.None
- TaskContinuationOptions.None

But you can always override them, as in the example below for <c>TaskScheduler.Current</c>.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Hint(Hint.Resolve, "Off")
    // Overrides TaskScheduler.Default if necessary
    .Bind<TaskScheduler>().To(_ => TaskScheduler.Current)
    // Specifies to use CancellationToken from the composition root argument,
    // if not specified, then CancellationToken.None will be used
    .RootArg<CancellationToken>("cancellationToken")
    .Bind<IDataService>().To<DataService>()
    .Bind<ICommand>().To<LoadDataCommand>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<ICommand>("GetCommand");

var composition = new Composition();
using var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();

// Creates a composition root with the CancellationToken passed to it
var command = composition.GetCommand(cancellationTokenSource.Token);
await command.ExecuteAsync(cancellationTokenSource.Token);

interface IDataService
{
    ValueTask<string[]> GetItemsAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

class DataService : IDataService
{
    public ValueTask<string[]> GetItemsAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
        new(["Item1", "Item2"]);
}

interface ICommand
{
    Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

class LoadDataCommand(Task<IDataService> dataServiceTask) : ICommand
{
    public async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Simulating some processing before needing the dependency
        await Task.Delay(1, cancellationToken);

        // The dependency is resolved asynchronously, so we await it here.
        // This allows the dependency to be created in parallel with the execution of this method.
        var dataService = await dataServiceTask;
        var items = await dataService.GetItemsAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## ValueTask

```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IConnection>().To<CloudConnection>()
    .Bind<IDataProcessor>().To<DataProcessor>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IDataProcessor>("DataProcessor");

var composition = new Composition();
var processor = composition.DataProcessor;
await processor.ProcessDataAsync();

interface IConnection
{
    ValueTask<bool> PingAsync();
}

class CloudConnection : IConnection
{
    public ValueTask<bool> PingAsync() => ValueTask.FromResult(true);
}

interface IDataProcessor
{
    ValueTask ProcessDataAsync();
}

class DataProcessor(ValueTask<IConnection> connectionTask) : IDataProcessor
{
    public async ValueTask ProcessDataAsync()
    {
        // The connection is resolved asynchronously, allowing potential
        // non-blocking initialization or resource allocation.
        var connection = await connectionTask;
        await connection.PingAsync();
    }
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)


## Manually started tasks

By default, tasks are started automatically when they are injected. But you can override this behavior as shown in the example below. It is also recommended to add a binding for <c>CancellationToken</c> to be able to cancel the execution of a task.

```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Overrides the default binding that performs an auto-start of a task
    // when it is created. This binding will simply create the task.
    // The start will be handled by the consumer.
    .Bind<Task<TT>>().To(ctx => {
        ctx.Inject(ctx.Tag, out Func<TT> factory);
        ctx.Inject(out CancellationToken cancellationToken);
        return new Task<TT>(factory, cancellationToken);
    })
    // Specifies to use CancellationToken from the composition root argument,
    // if not specified, then CancellationToken.None will be used
    .RootArg<CancellationToken>("cancellationToken")
    .Bind<IUserPreferences>().To<UserPreferences>()
    .Bind<IDashboardService>().To<DashboardService>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IDashboardService>("GetDashboard");

var composition = new Composition();
using var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();

// Creates a composition root with the CancellationToken passed to it
var dashboard = composition.GetDashboard(cancellationTokenSource.Token);
await dashboard.LoadAsync(cancellationTokenSource.Token);

interface IUserPreferences
{
    ValueTask LoadAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

class UserPreferences : IUserPreferences
{
    public ValueTask LoadAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) => ValueTask.CompletedTask;
}

interface IDashboardService
{
    Task LoadAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

class DashboardService : IDashboardService
{
    private readonly Task<IUserPreferences> _preferencesTask;

    public DashboardService(Task<IUserPreferences> preferencesTask)
    {
        _preferencesTask = preferencesTask;
        // The task is started manually in the constructor.
        // This allows the loading of preferences to begin immediately in the background,
        // while the service continues its initialization.
        _preferencesTask.Start();
    }

    public async Task LoadAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Wait for the preferences loading task to complete
        var preferences = await _preferencesTask;
        await preferences.LoadAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The method `Inject()`cannot be used outside of the binding setup.

## Span and ReadOnlySpan

Specifying `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` work the same as with the array `T[]`.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<Point>('a').To(_ => new Point(1, 1))
    .Bind<Point>('b').To(_ => new Point(2, 2))
    .Bind<Point>('c').To(_ => new Point(3, 3))
    .Bind<IPath>().To<Path>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IPath>("Path");

var composition = new Composition();
var path = composition.Path;
path.PointCount.ShouldBe(3);

readonly struct Point(int x, int y)
{
    public int X { get; } = x;

    public int Y { get; } = y;
}

interface IPath
{
    int PointCount { get; }
}

class Path(ReadOnlySpan<Point> points) : IPath
{
    // The 'points' span is allocated on the stack, so it's very efficient.
    // However, we cannot store it in a field because it's a ref struct.
    // We can process it here in the constructor.
    public int PointCount { get; } = points.Length;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

This scenario is even more efficient in the case of `Span<T>` or `ReadOnlySpan<T>` when `T` is a value type. In this case, there is no heap allocation, and the composition root `IPath` looks like this:
```c#
public IPath Path
{
  get
  {
    ReadOnlySpan<Point> points = stackalloc Point[3] { new Point(1, 1), new Point(2, 2), new Point(3, 3) };
    return new Path(points);
  }
}
```

## Tuple

The tuples feature provides concise syntax to group multiple data elements in a lightweight data structure. The following example shows how a type can ask to inject a tuple argument into it:

```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IEngine>().To<ElectricEngine>()
    .Bind<Coordinates>().To(_ => new Coordinates(10, 20))
    .Bind<IVehicle>().To<Car>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IVehicle>("Vehicle");

var composition = new Composition();
var vehicle = composition.Vehicle;

interface IEngine;

class ElectricEngine : IEngine;

readonly record struct Coordinates(int X, int Y);

interface IVehicle
{
    IEngine Engine { get; }
}

class Car((Coordinates StartPosition, IEngine Engine) specs) : IVehicle
{
    // The tuple 'specs' groups the initialization data (like coordinates)
    // and dependencies (like engine) into a single lightweight argument.
    public IEngine Engine { get; } = specs.Engine;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)


## Weak Reference

```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<ILargeCache>().To<LargeCache>()
    .Bind<IService>().To<Service>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IService>("MyService");

var composition = new Composition();
var service = composition.MyService;

// Represents a large memory object (e.g., a cache of images or large datasets)
interface ILargeCache;

class LargeCache : ILargeCache;

interface IService;

class Service(WeakReference<ILargeCache> cache) : IService
{
    public ILargeCache? Cache =>
        // Tries to retrieve the target object from the WeakReference.
        // If the object has been collected by the GC, it returns null.
        cache.TryGetTarget(out var value)
            ? value
            : null;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)


## Async Enumerable

Specifying `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` as the injection type allows instances of all bindings implementing type `T` to be injected in an asynchronous-lazy manner - the instances will be provided one at a time, in an order corresponding to the sequence of the bindings.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IHealthCheck>().To<MemoryCheck>()
    .Bind<IHealthCheck>("External").To<ExternalServiceCheck>()
    .Bind<IHealthService>().To<HealthService>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IHealthService>("HealthService");

var composition = new Composition();
var healthService = composition.HealthService;
var checks = await healthService.GetChecksAsync();

checks[0].ShouldBeOfType<MemoryCheck>();
checks[1].ShouldBeOfType<ExternalServiceCheck>();

interface IHealthCheck;

class MemoryCheck : IHealthCheck;

class ExternalServiceCheck : IHealthCheck;

interface IHealthService
{
    Task<IReadOnlyList<IHealthCheck>> GetChecksAsync();
}

class HealthService(IAsyncEnumerable<IHealthCheck> checks) : IHealthService
{
    public async Task<IReadOnlyList<IHealthCheck>> GetChecksAsync()
    {
        var results = new List<IHealthCheck>();
        await foreach (var check in checks)
        {
            results.Add(check);
        }

        return results;
    }
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)


## Generics

Generic types are also supported.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Instead of open generic types, as in classical DI container libraries, regular generic types with _marker_ types as type parameters are used here. Such "marker" types allow to define dependency graph more precisely.

For the case of `IDependency<TT>`, `TT` is a _marker_ type, which allows the usual `IDependency<TT>` to be used instead of an open generic type like `IDependency<>`. This makes it easy to bind generic types by specifying _marker_ types such as `TT`, `TT1`, etc. as parameters of generic types:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // This hint indicates to not generate methods such as Resolve
    .Hint(Hint.Resolve, "Off")
    // Binding a generic interface to a generic implementation
    // using the marker type TT. This allows Pure.DI to match
    // IRepository<User> to Repository<User>, IRepository<Order> to Repository<Order>, etc.
    .Bind<IRepository<TT>>().To<Repository<TT>>()
    .Bind<IDataService>().To<DataService>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IDataService>("DataService");

var composition = new Composition();
var dataService = composition.DataService;

// Verifying that the correct generic types were injected
dataService.Users.ShouldBeOfType<Repository<User>>();
dataService.Orders.ShouldBeOfType<Repository<Order>>();

interface IRepository<T>;

class Repository<T> : IRepository<T>;

// Domain entities
record User;

record Order;

interface IDataService
{
    IRepository<User> Users { get; }

    IRepository<Order> Orders { get; }
}

class DataService(
    IRepository<User> users,
    IRepository<Order> orders)
    : IDataService
{
    public IRepository<User> Users { get; } = users;

    public IRepository<Order> Orders { get; } = orders;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

Actually, the property _Root_ looks like:
```c#
public IService Root
{
  get
  {
    return new Service(new Dependency<int>(), new Dependency<string>());
  }
}
```
Even in this simple scenario, it is not possible to precisely define the binding of an abstraction to its implementation using open generic types:
```c#
.Bind(typeof(IMap<,>)).To(typeof(Map<,>))
```
You can try to match them by order or by name derived from the .NET type reflection. But this is not reliable, since order and name matching is not guaranteed. For example, there is some interface with two arguments of type _key and _value_. But in its implementation the sequence of type arguments is mixed up: first comes the _value_ and then the _key_ and the names do not match:
```c#
class Map<TV, TK>: IMap<TKey, TValue> { }
```
At the same time, the marker types `TT1` and `TT2` handle this easily. They determine the exact correspondence between the type arguments in the interface and its implementation:
```c#
.Bind<IMap<TT1, TT2>>().To<Map<TT2, TT1>>()
```
The first argument of the type in the interface, corresponds to the second argument of the type in the implementation and is a _key_. The second argument of the type in the interface, corresponds to the first argument of the type in the implementation and is a _value_. This is a simple example. Obviously, there are plenty of more complex scenarios where tokenized types will be useful.
Marker types are regular .NET types marked with a special attribute, such as:
```c#
[GenericTypeArgument]
internal abstract class TT1 { }

[GenericTypeArgument]
internal abstract class TT2 { }
```
This way you can easily create your own, including making them fit the constraints on the type parameter, for example:
```c#
[GenericTypeArgument]
internal struct TTS { }

[GenericTypeArgument]
internal interface TTDisposable: IDisposable { }

[GenericTypeArgument]
internal interface TTEnumerator<out T>: IEnumerator<T> { }
```

## Generic composition roots

Sometimes you want to be able to create composition roots with type parameters. In this case, the composition root can only be represented by a method.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Resolve()' methods cannot be used to resolve generic composition roots.

```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // This hint indicates to not generate methods such as Resolve
    .Hint(Hint.Resolve, "Off")
    .Bind().To<Repository<TT>>()
    .Bind().To<CreateCommandHandler<TT>>()
    // Creates UpdateCommandHandler manually,
    // just for the sake of example
    .Bind("Update").To(ctx => {
        ctx.Inject(out IRepository<TT> repository);
        return new UpdateCommandHandler<TT>(repository);
    })

    // Specifies to create a regular public method
    // to get a composition root of type ICommandHandler<T>
    // with the name "GetCreateCommandHandler"
    .Root<ICommandHandler<TT>>("GetCreateCommandHandler")

    // Specifies to create a regular public method
    // to get a composition root of type ICommandHandler<T>
    // with the name "GetUpdateCommandHandler"
    // using the "Update" tag
    .Root<ICommandHandler<TT>>("GetUpdateCommandHandler", "Update");

var composition = new Composition();

// createHandler = new CreateCommandHandler<int>(new Repository<int>());
var createHandler = composition.GetCreateCommandHandler<int>();

// updateHandler = new UpdateCommandHandler<string>(new Repository<string>());
var updateHandler = composition.GetUpdateCommandHandler<string>();

interface IRepository<T>;

class Repository<T> : IRepository<T>;

interface ICommandHandler<T>;

class CreateCommandHandler<T>(IRepository<T> repository) : ICommandHandler<T>;

class UpdateCommandHandler<T>(IRepository<T> repository) : ICommandHandler<T>;
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet package must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The method `Inject()`cannot be used outside of the binding setup.

## Complex generics

Defining generic type arguments using particular marker types like ```TT``` in this sample is a distinguishing and outstanding feature. This allows binding complex generic types with nested generic types and with any type constraints. For instance ```IService<T1, T2, TList, TDictionary> where T2: struct where TList: IList<T1> where TDictionary: IDictionary<T1, T2> { }``` and its binding to the some implementation ```.Bind<IService<TT1, TTS2, TTList<TT1>, TTDictionary<TT1, TTS2>>>().To<Service<TT1, TTS2, TTList<TT1>, TTDictionary<TT1, TTS2>>>()``` with all checks and code-generation at the compile time. It is clear that this example is exaggerated, it just demonstrates the ease of working with marker types like ```TT, TTEnumerable, TTSet``` and etc. for binding complex generic types.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // This hint indicates to not generate methods such as Resolve
    .Hint(Hint.Resolve, "Off")
    .RootArg<TT>("name")
    .Bind<IConsumer<TT>>().To<Consumer<TT>>()
    .Bind<IConsumer<TTS>>("struct")
    .As(Lifetime.Singleton)
    .To<StructConsumer<TTS>>()
    .Bind<IWorkflow<TT1, TTS2, TTList<TT1>, TTDictionary<TT1, TTS2>>>()
    .To<Workflow<TT1, TTS2, TTList<TT1>, TTDictionary<TT1, TTS2>>>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<Program<TT>>("GetRoot");

var composition = new Composition();
var program = composition.GetRoot<string>(name: "Super Task");
var workflow = program.Workflow;
workflow.ShouldBeOfType<Workflow<string, int, List<string>, Dictionary<string, int>>>();
workflow.TaskConsumer.ShouldBeOfType<Consumer<string>>();
workflow.PriorityConsumer.ShouldBeOfType<StructConsumer<int>>();

interface IConsumer<T>;

class Consumer<T>(T name) : IConsumer<T>;

readonly record struct StructConsumer<T> : IConsumer<T>
    where T : struct;

interface IWorkflow<TTask, TPriority, TTaskList, TTaskPriorities>
    where TPriority : struct
    where TTaskList : IList<TTask>
    where TTaskPriorities : IDictionary<TTask, TPriority>
{
    IConsumer<TTask> TaskConsumer { get; }

    IConsumer<TPriority> PriorityConsumer { get; }
}

class Workflow<TTask, TPriority, TTaskList, TTaskPriorities>(
    IConsumer<TTask> taskConsumer,
    [Tag("struct")] IConsumer<TPriority> priorityConsumer)
    : IWorkflow<TTask, TPriority, TTaskList, TTaskPriorities>
    where TPriority : struct
    where TTaskList : IList<TTask>
    where TTaskPriorities : IDictionary<TTask, TPriority>
{
    public IConsumer<TTask> TaskConsumer { get; } = taskConsumer;

    public IConsumer<TPriority> PriorityConsumer { get; } = priorityConsumer;
}

class Program<T>(IWorkflow<T, int, List<T>, Dictionary<T, int>> workflow)
    where T : notnull
{
    public IWorkflow<T, int, List<T>, Dictionary<T, int>> Workflow { get; } = workflow;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

It can also be useful in a very simple scenario where, for example, the sequence of type arguments does not match the sequence of arguments of the contract that implements the type.

## Generic composition roots with constraints

    // Creates SpecializedDataProcessor manually,
    // just for the sake of example.
    // It treats 'bool' as the options type for specific boolean flags.

## Build up of an existing generic object

In other words, injecting the necessary dependencies via methods, properties, or fields into an existing object.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .RootArg<string>("userName")
    .Bind().To(_ => Guid.NewGuid())
    .Bind().To(ctx => {
        // The "BuildUp" method injects dependencies into an existing object.
        // This is useful when the object is created externally (e.g., by a UI framework
        // or an ORM) or requires specific initialization before injection.
        var context = new UserContext<TTS>();
        ctx.BuildUp(context);
        return context;
    })
    .Bind().To<Facade<TTS>>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IFacade<Guid>>("GetFacade");

var composition = new Composition();
var facade = composition.GetFacade("Erik");

facade.Context.UserName.ShouldBe("Erik");
facade.Context.Id.ShouldNotBe(Guid.Empty);

interface IUserContext<out T>
    where T : struct
{
    string UserName { get; }

    T Id { get; }
}

class UserContext<T> : IUserContext<T>
    where T : struct
{
    // The Dependency attribute specifies to perform an injection
    [Dependency]
    public string UserName { get; set; } = "";

    public T Id { get; private set; }

    // The Dependency attribute specifies to perform an injection
    [Dependency]
    public void SetId(T id) => Id = id;
}

using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .RootArg<TT>("model")
    .Bind<IPresenter<TT>>().To<Presenter<TT>>()

    // Composition root

## Constructor ordinal attribute

When applied to any constructor in a type, automatic injection constructor selection is disabled. The selection will only focus on constructors marked with this attribute, in the appropriate order from smallest value to largest.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Arg<string>("connectionString")
    .Bind().To<Configuration>()
    .Bind().To<SqlDatabaseClient>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IDatabaseClient>("Client");

var composition = new Composition(connectionString: "Server=.;Database=MyDb;");
var client = composition.Client;

// The client was created using the connection string constructor (Ordinal 0)
// even though the configuration constructor (Ordinal 1) was also possible.
client.ConnectionString.ShouldBe("Server=.;Database=MyDb;");

interface IConfiguration;

class Configuration : IConfiguration;

interface IDatabaseClient
{
    string ConnectionString { get; }
}

class SqlDatabaseClient : IDatabaseClient
{
    // The integer value in the argument specifies
    // the ordinal of injection.
    // The DI container will try to use this constructor first (Ordinal 0).
    [Ordinal(0)]
    internal SqlDatabaseClient(string connectionString) =>
        ConnectionString = connectionString;

    // If the first constructor cannot be used (e.g. connectionString is missing),
    // the DI container will try to use this one (Ordinal 1).
    [Ordinal(1)]
    public SqlDatabaseClient(IConfiguration configuration) =>
        ConnectionString = "Server=.;Database=DefaultDb;";

    public SqlDatabaseClient() =>
        ConnectionString = "InMemory";

    public string ConnectionString { get; }
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

The attribute `Ordinal` is part of the API, but you can use your own attribute at any time, and this allows you to define them in the assembly and namespace you want.

## Dependency attribute

When applied to a property or field, these type members will also participate in dependency injection in the appropriate order from smallest value to largest.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using System.Text;

DI.Setup(nameof(PersonComposition))
    .Arg<int>("personId")
    .Arg<string>("personName")
    .Arg<DateTime>("personBirthday")
    .Bind().To<Person>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IPerson>("Person");

var composition = new PersonComposition(
    personId: 123,
    personName: "Nik",
    personBirthday: new DateTime(1977, 11, 16));

var person = composition.Person;
person.Name.ShouldBe("123 Nik 1977-11-16");

interface IPerson
{
    string Name { get; }
}

class Person : IPerson
{
    private readonly StringBuilder _name = new();

    public string Name => _name.ToString();

    [Dependency] public int Id;

    // The Ordinal attribute specifies to perform an injection,
    // the integer value in the argument specifies
    // the ordinal of injection
    [Dependency(ordinal: 1)]
    public string FirstName
    {
        set
        {
            _name.Append(Id);
            _name.Append(' ');
            _name.Append(value);
        }
    }

    [Dependency(ordinal: 2)]
    public DateTime Birthday
    {
        set
        {
            _name.Append(' ');
            _name.Append($"{value:yyyy-MM-dd}");
        }
    }
}
```

The attribute `Dependency` is part of the API, but you can use your own attribute at any time, and this allows you to define them in the assembly and namespace you want.

## Member ordinal attribute

When applied to a property or field, these type members will also participate in dependency injection in the appropriate order from smallest value to largest.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;
using System.Text;

DI.Setup(nameof(PersonComposition))
    .Arg<int>("personId")
    .Arg<string>("personName")
    .Arg<DateTime>("personBirthday")
    .Bind().To<Person>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IPerson>("Person");

var composition = new PersonComposition(
    personId: 123,
    personName: "Nik",
    personBirthday: new DateTime(1977, 11, 16));

var person = composition.Person;
person.Name.ShouldBe("123 Nik 1977-11-16");

interface IPerson
{
    string Name { get; }
}

class Person : IPerson
{
    private readonly StringBuilder _name = new();

    public string Name => _name.ToString();

    // The Ordinal attribute specifies to perform an injection,
    // the integer value in the argument specifies
    // the ordinal of injection
    [Ordinal(0)] public int Id;

    [Ordinal(1)]
    public string FirstName
    {
        set
        {
            _name.Append(Id);
            _name.Append(' ');
            _name.Append(value);
        }
    }

    [Ordinal(2)]
    public DateTime Birthday
    {
        set
        {
            _name.Append(' ');
            _name.Append($"{value:yyyy-MM-dd}");
        }
    }

The attribute `Ordinal` is part of the API, but you can use your own attribute at any time, and this allows you to define them in the assembly and namespace you want.

## Tag attribute

Sometimes it's important to take control of building a dependency graph. For example, when there are multiple implementations of the same contract. In this case, _tags_ will help:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind("Fast").To<FastRenderer>()
    .Bind("Quality").To<QualityRenderer>()
    .Bind().To<PageRenderer>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IPageRenderer>("Renderer");

var composition = new Composition();
var pageRenderer = composition.Renderer;
pageRenderer.FastRenderer.ShouldBeOfType<FastRenderer>();
pageRenderer.QualityRenderer.ShouldBeOfType<QualityRenderer>();

interface IRenderer;

class FastRenderer : IRenderer;

class QualityRenderer : IRenderer;

interface IPageRenderer
{
    IRenderer FastRenderer { get; }

    IRenderer QualityRenderer { get; }
}

class PageRenderer(
    [Tag("Fast")] IRenderer fastRenderer,
    [Tag("Quality")] IRenderer qualityRenderer)
    : IPageRenderer
{
    public IRenderer FastRenderer { get; } = fastRenderer;

    public IRenderer QualityRenderer { get; } = qualityRenderer;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

The tag can be a constant, a type, a [smart tag](smart-tags.md), or a value of an `Enum` type. This attribute is part of the API, but you can use your own attribute at any time, and this allows you to define them in the assembly and namespace you want.

## Type attribute

The injection type can be defined manually using the `Type` attribute. This attribute explicitly overrides an injected type, otherwise it would be determined automatically based on the type of the constructor/method, property, or field parameter.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind().To<NotificationService>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<INotificationService>("NotificationService");

var composition = new Composition();
var notificationService = composition.NotificationService;
notificationService.UserNotifier.ShouldBeOfType<EmailSender>();
notificationService.AdminNotifier.ShouldBeOfType<SmsSender>();

interface IMessageSender;

class EmailSender : IMessageSender;

class SmsSender : IMessageSender;

interface INotificationService
{
    IMessageSender UserNotifier { get; }

    IMessageSender AdminNotifier { get; }
}

class NotificationService(
    // The [Type] attribute forces the injection of a specific type,
    // overriding the default resolution behavior.
    [Type(typeof(EmailSender))] IMessageSender userNotifier,
    [Type(typeof(SmsSender))] IMessageSender adminNotifier)
    : INotificationService
{
    public IMessageSender UserNotifier { get; } = userNotifier;

    public IMessageSender AdminNotifier { get; } = adminNotifier;
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

This attribute is part of the API, but you can use your own attribute at any time, and this allows you to define them in the assembly and namespace you want.

## Inject attribute

If you want to use attributes in your libraries but don't want to create your own, you can add this package to your projects:

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Pure.DI.Abstractions)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI.Abstractions)

It contains attributes like `Inject` and `Inject<T>` that work for constructors and their arguments, methods and their arguments, properties and fields. They allow you to setup all injection parameters.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI.Abstractions;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(PersonComposition))
    .Arg<int>("personId")
    .Bind<Uri>("Person Uri").To(_ => new Uri("https://github.com/DevTeam/Pure.DI"))
    .Bind("NikName").To(_ => "Nik")
    .Bind().To<Person>()

    // Composition root
    .Root<IPerson>("Person");

var composition = new PersonComposition(personId: 123);
var person = composition.Person;
person.ToString().ShouldBe("123 Nik https://github.com/DevTeam/Pure.DI");

interface IPerson;

class Person([Inject("NikName")] string name) : IPerson
{
    private object? _state;

    [Inject<int>] internal object Id = "";

    public void Initialize([Inject<Uri>("Person Uri", 1)] object state) =>
        _state = state;

    public override string ToString() => $"{Id} {name} {_state}";
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)
 - [Pure.DI.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI.Abstractions)

This package should also be included in a project:

## Decorator

Interception is the ability to intercept calls between objects in order to enrich or change their behavior, but without having to change their code. A prerequisite for interception is weak binding. That is, if programming is abstraction-based, the underlying implementation can be transformed or improved by "packaging" it into other implementations of the same abstraction. At its core, intercept is an application of the Decorator design pattern. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to inheritance by dynamically "attaching" additional responsibility to an object. Decorator "packs" one implementation of an abstraction into another implementation of the same abstraction like a "matryoshka doll".
_Decorator_ is a well-known and useful design pattern. It is convenient to use tagged dependencies to build a chain of nested decorators, as in the example below:

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind("base").To<TextWidget>()
    .Bind().To<BoxWidget>()
    .Root<IWidget>("Widget");

var composition = new Composition();
var widget = composition.Widget;
widget.Render().ShouldBe("[ Hello World ]");

interface IWidget
{
    string Render();
}

class TextWidget : IWidget
{
    public string Render() => "Hello World";
}

class BoxWidget([Tag("base")] IWidget baseWidget) : IWidget
{
    public string Render() => $"[ {baseWidget.Render()} ]";
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)

Here an instance of the _TextWidget_ type, labeled _"base"_, is injected in the decorator _BoxWidget_. You can use any tag that semantically reflects the feature of the abstraction being embedded. The tag can be a constant, a type, or a value of an enumerated type.

## Interception

Interception allows you to enrich or change the behavior of a certain set of objects from the object graph being created without changing the code of the corresponding types.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Castle.DynamicProxy;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
using Pure.DI;

// OnDependencyInjection = On
// OnDependencyInjectionContractTypeNameWildcard = *IGreeter
DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind().To<Greeter>()
    .Root<IGreeter>("Greeter");

var composition = new Composition();
var greeter = composition.Greeter;

// The greeting is modified by the interceptor
greeter.Greet("World").ShouldBe("Hello World !!!");

public interface IGreeter
{
    string Greet(string name);
}

class Greeter : IGreeter
{
    public string Greet(string name) => $"Hello {name}";
}

partial class Composition : IInterceptor
{
    private static readonly ProxyGenerator ProxyGenerator = new();

    // Intercepts the instantiation of services to wrap them in a proxy
    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
    private partial T OnDependencyInjection<T>(
        in T value,
        object? tag,
        Lifetime lifetime)
    {
        // Proxying is only possible for reference types (interfaces, classes)
        if (typeof(T).IsValueType)
        {
            return value;
        }

        // Creates a proxy that delegates calls to the 'value' object
        // and passes them through the 'this' interceptor
        return (T)ProxyGenerator.CreateInterfaceProxyWithTargetInterface(
            typeof(T),
            value,
            this);
    }

    // Logic performed when a method on the proxy is called
    public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
    {
        // Executes the original method
        invocation.Proceed();

        // Enhances the result of the Greet method
        if (invocation.Method.Name == nameof(IGreeter.Greet)
            && invocation.ReturnValue is string message)
        {
            invocation.ReturnValue = $"{message} !!!";
        }
    }
}
```

To run the above code, the following NuGet packages must be added:
 - [Pure.DI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pure.DI)
 - [Shouldly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shouldly)
 - [Castle.DynamicProxy](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Castle.DynamicProxy)

Using an intercept gives you the ability to add end-to-end functionality such as:

- Logging

- Action logging

- Performance monitoring

- Security

- Caching

- Error handling

- Providing resistance to failures, etc.

## Advanced interception

This approach of interception maximizes performance by precompiling the proxy object factory.

```c#
using Shouldly;
using Castle.DynamicProxy;
using System.Collections.Immutable;
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
using Pure.DI;

// OnDependencyInjection = On
DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind().To<DataService>()
    .Bind().To<BusinessService>()
    .Root<IBusinessService>("BusinessService");

var log = new List<string>();
var composition = new Composition(log);
var businessService = composition.BusinessService;

// Взаимодействие с сервисами для проверки перехвата
businessService.Process();
businessService.DataService.Count();

log.ShouldBe(
    ImmutableArray.Create(
        "Process returns Processed",
        "get_DataService returns Castle.Proxies.IDataServiceProxy",
        "Count returns 55"));

public interface IDataService
{
    int Count();
}

class DataService : IDataService
{
    public int Count() => 55;
}

public interface IBusinessService
{
    IDataService DataService { get; }

    string Process();
}

class BusinessService(IDataService dataService) : IBusinessService
{
    public IDataService DataService { get; } = dataService;

    public string Process() => "Processed";
}

internal partial class Composition : IInterceptor
{
    private readonly List<string> _log = [];
    private static readonly IProxyBuilder ProxyBuilder = new DefaultProxyBuilder();
    private readonly IInterceptor[] _interceptors = [];

    public Composition(List<string> log)
    {
        _log = log;
        _interceptors = [this];
    }

    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
    private partial T OnDependencyInjection<T>(
        in T value,
        object? tag,
        Lifetime lifetime)
    {
        if (typeof(T).IsValueType)
        {
            return value;
        }

        return ProxyFactory<T>.GetFactory(ProxyBuilder)(
            value,
            _interceptors);
    }

    public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
    {
        invocation.Proceed();
        _log.Add($"{invocation.Method.Name} returns {invocation.ReturnValue}");
    }

    private static class ProxyFactory<T>
    {
        private static Func<T, IInterceptor[], T>? _factory;

        public static Func<T, IInterceptor[], T> GetFactory(IProxyBuilder proxyBuilder) =>
            _factory ?? CreateFactory(proxyBuilder);

        private static Func<T, IInterceptor[], T> CreateFactory(IProxyBuilder proxyBuilder)
        {
            // Compiles a delegate to create a proxy for the performance boost
            var proxyType = proxyBuilder.CreateInterfaceProxyTypeWithTargetInterface(
                typeof(T),
                Type.EmptyTypes,
                ProxyGenerationOptions.Default);
            var ctor = proxyType.GetConstructors()
                .Single(i => i.GetParameters().Length == 2);
            var instance = Expression.Parameter(typeof(T));
            var interceptors = Expression.Parameter(typeof(IInterceptor[]));
            var newProxyExpression = Expression.New(ctor, interceptors, instance);
            return _factory = Expression.Lambda<Func<T, IInterceptor[], T>>(
                    newProxyExpression,
                    instance,
                    interceptors)
                .Compile();
        }
    }
}
```
