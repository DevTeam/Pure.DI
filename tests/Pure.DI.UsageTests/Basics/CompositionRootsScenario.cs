$d=Composition roots
$h=This example demonstrates several ways to create a composition root.
$h=> [!TIP]
$h=> There is no limit to the number of roots, but you should consider limiting the number of roots. Ideally, an application should have a single composition root.
$h=
$h=If you use classic DI containers, the composition is resolved dynamically every time you call a method similar to `T Resolve<T>()` or `object GetService(Type type)`. The root of the composition there is simply the root type of the composition of objects in memory `T` or `Type` type. There can be as many of these as you like. In the case of Pure.DI, the number of composition roots is limited because for each composition root a separate property or method is created at compile time. Therefore, each root is defined explicitly by calling the `Root(string rootName)` method.
$f=The name of the composition root is arbitrarily chosen depending on its purpose, but should be restricted by the property naming conventions in C# since it is the same name as a property in the composition class. In reality, the _Root_ property has the form:
$f=```c#
$f=public IService Root
$f={
$f=  get
$f=  {
$f=    return new Service(new Dependency());
$f=  }
$f=}
$f=```
$f=To avoid generating _Resolve_ methods just add a comment `// Resolve = Off` before a _Setup_ method:
$f=```c#
$f=// Resolve = Off
$f=DI.Setup("Composition")
$f=  .Bind<IDependency>().To<Dependency>()
$f=  ...
$f=```
$f=This can be done if these methods are not needed, in case only certain composition roots are used. It's not significant then, but it will help save resources during compilation.
