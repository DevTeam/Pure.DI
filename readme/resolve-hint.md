#### Resolve hint

[![CSharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-code-blue.svg)](../tests/Pure.DI.UsageTests/Hints/ResolveHintScenario.cs)

Hints are used to fine-tune code generation. The _Resolve_ hint determines whether to generate _Resolve_ methods. By default a set of four _Resolve_ methods are generated. Set this hint to _Off_ to disable the generation of resolve methods. This will reduce class composition generation time and no private composition roots will be generated in this case. When the _Resolve_ hint is disabled, only the public root properties are available, so be sure to define them explicitly with the `Root<T>(...)` method.
In addition, setup hints can be comments before the _Setup_ method in the form ```hint = value```, for example: `// Resolve = Off`.


```c#
using Pure.DI;
using static Pure.DI.Hint;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Hint(Resolve, "Off")
    .Bind().To<Dependency>()
    .Root<IDependency>("DependencyRoot")
    .Bind().To<Service>()
    .Root<IService>("Root");

var composition = new Composition();
var service = composition.Root;
var dependencyRoot = composition.DependencyRoot;

interface IDependency;

class Dependency : IDependency;

interface IService;

class Service(IDependency dependency) : IService;
```
