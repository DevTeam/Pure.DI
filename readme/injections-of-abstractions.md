#### Injections of abstractions

[![CSharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-code-blue.svg)](../tests/Pure.DI.UsageTests/Basics/InjectionsOfAbstractionsScenario.cs)

This example demonstrates the recommended approach of using abstractions instead of implementations when injecting dependencies.


```c#
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    // Binding abstractions to their implementations
    .Bind<IDependency>().To<Dependency>()
    .Bind<IService>().To<Service>()

    // Specifies to create a composition root
    // of type "Program" with the name "Root"
    .Root<Program>("Root");

var composition = new Composition();

// var root = new Program(new Service(new Dependency()));
var root = composition.Root;

root.Run();

interface IDependency;

class Dependency : IDependency;

interface IService
{
    void DoSomething();
}

class Service(IDependency dependency) : IService
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
    }
}

partial class Program(IService service)
{
    public void Run() => service.DoSomething();
}
```

Usually the biggest block in the setup is the chain of bindings, which describes which implementation corresponds to which abstraction. This is necessary so that the code generator can build a composition of objects using only NOT abstract types. This is true because the cornerstone of DI technology implementation is the principle of abstraction-based programming rather than concrete class-based programming. Thanks to it, it is possible to replace one concrete implementation by another. And each implementation can correspond to an arbitrary number of abstractions.
> [!TIP]
> Even if the binding is not defined, there is no problem with the injection, but obviously under the condition that the consumer requests an injection NOT of abstract type.
