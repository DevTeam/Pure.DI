#### Composition arguments

Sometimes you need to pass some state to a composition class to use it when resolving dependencies. To do this, just use the `Arg<T>(string argName)` method, specify the type of argument and its name. You can also specify a tag for each argument. You can then use them as dependencies when building the object graph. If you have multiple arguments of the same type, just use tags to distinguish them. The values of the arguments are manipulated when you create a composition class by calling its constructor. It is important to remember that only those arguments that are used in the object graph will appear in the constructor. Arguments that are not involved will not be added to the constructor arguments.
> [!NOTE]
> Actually, composition arguments work like normal bindings. The difference is that they bind to the values of the arguments. These values will be injected wherever they are required.



```c#
using Shouldly;
using Pure.DI;

DI.Setup(nameof(Composition))
    .Bind<IBankGateway>().To<BankGateway>()
    .Bind<IPaymentProcessor>().To<PaymentProcessor>()

    // Composition root "PaymentService"
    .Root<IPaymentProcessor>("PaymentService")

    // Composition argument: Connection timeout (e.g., from config)
    .Arg<int>("timeoutSeconds")

    // Composition argument: API Token (using a tag to distinguish from other strings)
    .Arg<string>("authToken", "api token")

    // Composition argument: Bank gateway address
    .Arg<string>("gatewayUrl");

// Create the composition, passing real settings from "outside"
var composition = new Composition(
    timeoutSeconds: 30,
    authToken: "secret_token_123",
    gatewayUrl: "https://api.bank.com/v1");

var paymentService = composition.PaymentService;

paymentService.Token.ShouldBe("secret_token_123");
paymentService.Gateway.Timeout.ShouldBe(30);
paymentService.Gateway.Url.ShouldBe("https://api.bank.com/v1");

interface IBankGateway
{
    int Timeout { get; }

    string Url { get; }
}

// Simulation of a bank gateway client
class BankGateway(int timeoutSeconds, string gatewayUrl) : IBankGateway
{
    public int Timeout { get; } = timeoutSeconds;

    public string Url { get; } = gatewayUrl;
}

interface IPaymentProcessor
{
    string Token { get; }

    IBankGateway Gateway { get; }
}

// Payment processing service
class PaymentProcessor(
    // The tag allows specifying exactly which string to inject here
    [Tag("api token")] string token,
    IBankGateway gateway) : IPaymentProcessor
{
    public string Token { get; } = token;

    public IBankGateway Gateway { get; } = gateway;
}
